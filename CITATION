There are currently two Accelerator Physics proceedings that should be cited for this module. There is on-going work to prepare a 
paper for a refereed journal on this topic. 

1 - T. A. Mohayai, C. Rogers, P. Snopok, "Simulated Measurements of Cooling in Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment", IPAC'15 Proceedi-
ngs.
2 - T. A. Mohayai, C. Rogers, D. Neuffer, P. Snopok, "Simulated Measurements of Beam Cooling in Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment", 
NA-PAC'16 Proceedings.
